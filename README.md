The Single File PHP Gallery is a web-based gallery that is contained in a single PHP file. 
By simply copying the script into any directory that holds images, a gallery will be created, with sub-directories becoming sub-galleries. 
Thumbnails for both images and directories are generated automatically and no configuration or programming expertise is required to use it.
